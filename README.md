#ðŸš† Railway Operations Data Analysis with R Markdown ðŸ“ˆ â€” My First Hands-On R Project

I recently completed a comprehensive data analysis project focused on railway operations as part of my Business Intelligence and Visual Analytics course. Using R and R Markdown, I worked through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and reporting to uncover meaningful insights about ticket sales, payment methods, and train delays.

#ðŸ”Ž Key Aspects of the Project:
âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed raw data to ensure accuracy and usability
âœ… Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations on ticket purchases and payment patterns
âœ… Analyzed train delay trends across different days and causes
âœ… Compiled an organized, dynamic report using R Markdown to present findings clearly

#ðŸ§° Tools & Packages:
R, tidyverse suite, ggplot2, dplyr, knitr, R Markdown

This project sharpened my data wrangling and visualization skills while applying R to a real-world transport dataset.
